# 📌 Sentiment Analysis Project

## 📖 Description
This project focuses on **Sentiment Analysis**, which involves analyzing text data to determine its emotional tone—whether it's **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. This technique is widely used for analyzing **customer feedback**, **social media trends**, and **public opinion**.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains text samples with labeled sentiments. It was preprocessed and cleaned to remove **noise, stopwords, and special characters** for accurate model training.

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Challenges
✅ **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the emotional tone of text.
✅ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Processing and understanding human language.
✅ **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing algorithms such as **Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes**.
✅ **Feature Engineering**: Extracting relevant features using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
✅ **Data Visualization**: Presenting results using plots, including a **confusion matrix**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 🐍**
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
- **NLTK & Scikit-learn** (Text Processing & Machine Learning)
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)

## 🚀 Implementation Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** ✨
2. **Feature Extraction using TF-IDF** 🔍
3. **Model Training & Evaluation** 📈
4. **Prediction & Visualization** 📊

## 📷 Results
